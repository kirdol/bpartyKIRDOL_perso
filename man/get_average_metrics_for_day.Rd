\title{Get average temperature, humidity, and pressure for a city on a specific day}
\usage{
get_average_metrics_for_day(city_name, api_key, day_number)
}
\arguments{
\item{city_name}{Character. The name of the city for which to retrieve the weather forecast.}

\item{api_key}{Character. Your OpenWeatherMap API key.}

\item{day_number}{Integer. The day in the forecast to retrieve, where 1 corresponds to the first day in the forecast. Should vary between 1 and 5.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with the following components:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{temperature}: Numeric. The average temperature for the specified day (in Celsius).
    \item \code{humidity}: Numeric. The average humidity for the specified day (as a fraction, e.g., 0.5 for 50%).
    \item \code{pressure}: Numeric. The average pressure for the specified day (in hPa).
  }
}
\description{
This function retrieves weather forecast data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API
and calculates the average temperature (in Celsius), humidity (as a fraction), and pressure (in hPa)
for a specified day in the forecast.
}
\details{
The function retrieves a 5-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API, filters the forecast data for the
specified day, and calculates the average temperature, humidity, and pressure. The temperature is
converted from Kelvin to Celsius, and humidity is converted to a fraction for convenience.

# Example usage:
city <- "London"
api_key <- "your_api_key_here"
day <- 2

# Get the average metrics for the second day in the forecast
metrics <- get_average_metrics_for_day(city_name = city, api_key = api_key, day_number = day)
print(metrics)
