\title{Variable radius function for a cone}
\usage{
cone_radius_vectorized_direct(x_vals)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_vals}{Numeric vector. A sequence of heights at which the radius is calculated.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `x_vals`, where each element represents the radius at the corresponding height.
}
\description{
This function computes the radius of a cone at various heights (`x_vals`) using a piecewise formula. The formula defines three distinct regions with specific calculations for the radius, ensuring smooth transitions between them.
}
\details{
The radius is determined as follows:
  \itemize{
    \item For \code{0 <= x_vals < 8}: Radius is calculated as \code{x_vals / 8}.
    \item For \code{8 <= x_vals < 8 + pi/2}: Radius is \code{1 + 1.5 * sin(x_vals - 8)}.
    \item For \code{x_vals >= 8 + pi/2}: Radius is \code{2.5 - 2 * cos(x_vals - 8)}.
  }
}
\examples{
# Radius at height 4.5
cone_radius_vectorized_direct(4.5)
# Generate a sequence of heights
heights <- seq(0, 12, length.out = 100)
# Compute the radius at each height
radii <- cone_radius_vectorized_direct(heights)
# Inspect the results
